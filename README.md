# portfolio-project

## Description
- I made this website to practice designing a webpage using CSS.
- This project contains advanced CSS and HTML.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
The webpage will present to the user three sections, including personal info, links to previous works, and contact info. Clicking on the tags located in the previous works will direct the user to the deployed webpage containing the specified project. The contact info section also contains links to visit the GitHub page, LinkedIn profile, or send an email to the address or call the phone number. The webpage will adapt to screens of different sizes.
